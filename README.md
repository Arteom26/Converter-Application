NOTE: All python files have been moved to the old folder and binaries have been removed. I am updating the program to Java so the python version is now depreciated.

This application's goal is to be able to convert the most popular currencies, weights, and other things.

More binaries will be released soon.

If you wish to compile run the python source code on your computer, you will need Python 3.4 or later.

If you have any questions please put them in the issues tab on sourceforge.

Note: Older versions are found on sourceforge
